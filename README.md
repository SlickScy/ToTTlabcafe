Hi there and welcome to the **To**pics in **T**opos **Theory** lab caf√©!
I am SlickScy, category theory enthusiast with abckground in (gravitational) physics, mathematics and a tad of theoretical compsci.
This page is designated as a sort of 'journal' for my mathematical endeavours in particular with regards to category theory, it's applications to physics and compsci and of course Topos Theory!

A main focus will lie on the didactic presentation of all material learned throughout this project, so these pages might be a suitable start for anyone interested in getting started on their own journey with getting acquainted with CT!

I hope you enjoy!
Of Course I am always gratefule for any constructive criticism, suggestions, inspiration and discussions.
